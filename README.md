# HW02 - Explore Gapminder and use `dplyr`

This repository contains my second homework assignment for the R course [STATS 545](http://stat545.com). A description of the assignment can be found [here](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/hw02/hw02.html) and important information about the course can be found in the [course classroom](http://stat545.com/Classroom/).

In this assignment I will explore a dataset and begin to establish a workflow for data frames using `dyplyr` and `ggplot2`.
